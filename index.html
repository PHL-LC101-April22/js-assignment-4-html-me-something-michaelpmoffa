         <h2>Hiss Spun - Chelsea Wolfe</h2>
         <img src="images/hiss.jpeg">
         <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">I was told in the summer of 2018 that I would have a paid month's vacation that October.  A film was to be shot where I worked
            and I decided to leave Philadelphia and explore the Pacific Northwest for the first time in 8 years.  I found myself at Holy Mountain Brewing
            on a cold Monday afternoon, enjoying a new sour beer from a just tapped keg.  As I talked to my company a loud whirl of feedback took over the 
            space, followed by a thunderous guitar chord.  I knew what it was right away; track 1 from Chelsea Wolfe's latest record.  I had only listened 
            to it once upon release, but in this particular moment it suddenly all made sense.  Sometimes it takes something extra for a person to click with
            an artwork; for me, on this day, it was realizing how grateful I was to be traveling, and processing the excitement of my trip to follow.

         <h2>Ok Computer - Radiohead</h2>
         <img src="images/OkC.png">
         <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">What more can be said about this album?  I was born in 1979, and I could argue before the awful Supreme Court that this is the greatest album to come 
            out in my lifetime.  I remember release day vividly; I was living at home about to start college.  Most of my friends were packing up and moving away while 
            I had opted to commute for my first year so I could work and save money before transferring to my university's main campus.  I felt somehow alone, and this 
            record comforted me in a way that no piece of music has before or since.  To look back now 25 years later and see how musicians still site this work as a defining 
            moment speaks to its' importance, and for me personally it's the reason I decided to finally learn how to play guitar.

         <h2>Loveless - My Bloody Valentine</h2>
         <img src="images/Loveless.png">
         <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph"></p>While released before my tastes were formed, this album was also a personal revolution.  I had come to it in high school after hearing an artist I admired mention
            it in an interview.  I won't lie and say I "got it" upon first listen, but as I matured and sought to expand my horizons this record is the beginning of me finding
            my guitar playing style.  I quickly understood that as I began to learn my instrument that technical prowess wasn't what was most important; rather, it was understanding
            one's own limitations, working within those confines while trying to get better, and establishing a unique sound through creativity.  Like Ok Computer I still listen to 
            Loveless regularly, and have even collected guitars with the sole purpose of tinkering with different tunings and leaving detailed notes on the exact sounds I want.  It was
            through the noise of this album that I first was reminded of the beauty of human potential.
